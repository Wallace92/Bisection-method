 The program contains three functions: <br>
  
<ul>
  <li>"equation" with the solved equation in current case </li>
  <p>
  $$ f(x) =  6x^3 - 12x^2 - 3x + 5$$
</p>
  <li>"bisection" the bisection algorithm that looking forward the roots at some interval with precision defied by number of iterations</li>
  <li>"interval" defines how dense the interval it is and perform the bisecion algorithm on each segment</li>
</ul>
Finally the roots are presented using matplotlib with beatiful latex graphics. The roots are marked with big doots and the values are printes in the console.
