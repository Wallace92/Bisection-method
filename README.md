 The program contains three functions: <br>
  
<ul>
  <li>"equation" with the solved equation in current case </li>
  <p>
  $$ f(x) = 2*x^3 + 3*x^2 + 3*x + 2$$
</p>
  <li>"bisection" the bisection algorithm that looking forward the roots at some interval with precision defied by number of iterations</li>
  <li>"interval" defines how dense the interval it is and perform the bisecion algorithm on each segment</li>
</ul>
Finally the roots are presented using matplotlib with beatiful latex graphics. The roots are marked with big doots and the values are printes in the console.
